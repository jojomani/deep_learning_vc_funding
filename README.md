Venture Funding with Deep Learning

Predict whether Alphabet Soup funding applicants will be successful, create a binary classification model using a deep neural network.

This challenge consists of three technical deliverables:

- Preprocess data for a neural network model.

- Use the model-fit-predict pattern to compile and evaluate a binary classification model.

- Optimize the model.
